The app follows a simple structure with the following key files and directories:

1. lib/main.dart: The entry point of the application. It initializes the app and defines the root widget.
2. lib/view: This directory contains individual screen files. In this task, we have a screens named login_page.dart, otp_verify_screen.dart, welcome_screen.dart, home_screen.dart. You can create additional screens and organize them in this directory.
3. lib/components: This directory contains reusable widgets that are used across different screens. In this task, we have a custom header, transaction list and card widget. Feel free to add more custom widgets as your app grows.
4. lib/utils: This directory contains reusable assets.
